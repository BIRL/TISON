TISON_LiverBioheat B:10,45C I37C 1000mm^3 dx10E-04m t5s

Folders/Files:-
Parameter: contain the data for each layer in the environment case studies.

Sample Results: contain the results for simulating the above case studies and using the "Export Layer" option for all Z-indices, at intervals across physical time.

Exportable files: contain the environment used to produce the results in our case studies. These are exportable using TISON EE's "Export Environment" option.

COMSOL Multiphysics® [1] software's bioheat transfer physics was used to verify the stated results. A length 10mm cube of liver tissue at body temperature was placed in different environments (10C, 45C) and heat transfer compared.
