The Boolean network, cell fate logic, and fixed nodes states has been adapted from the work of Cho et al 2016.(Reference: Cho S-H, Park S-M, Lee H-S, Lee H-Y, Cho K-H. Attractor landscape analysis of colorectal tumorigenesis and its reversion. BMC Syst Biol. 2016;10(1):96.)

Folders/Files:- 
Description: Contains the network type, analysis type and network name

Landscape: Contains the txt file for uploading landscape in TISON to visualize cell fate and attractor Landscapes.

Network: Contains the network for this case study which is a rule based Human Signaling Network with Boolean rules

Parameters: Contains the Search Duration and Sampling Rate and Heuristic values (if applicable)

Sample Results: Contains the sample Deterministic Results for this analysis using TISON's network editor

Cell_Fate_Classification_File: An excel file (.xlsx) which has the cell fates associated with the nodes as given in the network of Cho et al to study Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in Human Signaling Network.

Fixed_Nodes_States_File: Contains the fixed nodes states for the network.
