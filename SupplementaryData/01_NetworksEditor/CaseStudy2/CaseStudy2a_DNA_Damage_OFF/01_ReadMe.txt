The cell fate classification and network has been adapted from the work of Choi et al. (Reference: Choi M, Shi J, Jung SH, Chen X, Cho K. Attractor Landscape Analysis Reveals Feedback Loops in the p53 Network That Control the Cellular Response to DNA Damage. 2012;5(November)). 

Folders:-

02_Description: Contains a .txt file with the network name, network type and analysis type.

03_Network: Contains a .csv network file for this case study which is a weight-based 'p53 Network with DNA damage OFF'. The file contains node basal values and node interactions. 

04_Parameters: Contains a .csv file with the max iterations, heuristic search, and number of states used for network analysis (if applicable).

05_Cell Fate Classification: Contains a .csv file which has all the cell fates associated with the nodes as given in the network of Choi et al. to study the 'p53 Network' in MCF-7 cell lines.

06_Sample Results: Contains a .csv sample result files for Deterministic Analysis which is performed in TISON's Networks Editor using the aforementioned parameters and cell fate classification file.
