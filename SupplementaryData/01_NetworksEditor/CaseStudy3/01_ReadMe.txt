This input data has been inferred from the work of Han et al. (Reference: Han, B. & Wang, J. Quantifying robustness and dissipation cost of yeast cell cycle network: the funneled energy landscape perspectives. Biophys. J. 92, 3755â€“3763 (2007)).

Folders:-

02_Description: Contains a .txt file with the network name, network type and analysis type.

03_Network: Contains a .csv network file for this case study which is a weight-based 'Yeast Cell Cycle Network'. The file contains node basal values and node interactions. 

04_Parameters: Contains a .csv file with the degradation constant, noise, max iterations, precision, number of states and heuristic search used for this network analysis (if applicable).

05_Cell Fate Classification: Contains a .csv file which has all the cell fates associated with the nodes as given in the network of Han et al. to study cell cycle progression in a yeast cell.

06_Sample Results: Contains a .csv sample result files for Probabilistic Analysis which is performed in TISON's Networks Editor using the aforementioned parameters and cell fate classification file.
