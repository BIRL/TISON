The boolean network, cell fate classification, and fixed nodes states have been adapted from the work of Cho et al. 2016 (Reference: Cho S-H, Park S-M, Lee H-S, Lee H-Y, Cho K-H. Attractor landscape analysis of colorectal tumorigenesis and its reversion. BMC Syst Biol. 2016;10(1):96.).

Folders:-

02_Description: Contains a .txt file with the network name, network type and analysis type.

03_Network: Contains a .csv network file for this case study which is a rules-based 'Human Signaling Network' with boolean rules.

04_Parameters: Contains a .csv file with the max iterations, heuristic search, and number of states used for network analysis (if applicable).

05_Fixed Nodes States: Contains a .csv file with the fixed nodes states for the network.

06_Cell Fate Classification: Contains a .csv file which has all the cell fates associated with the nodes as given in the network of Cho et al. to study colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in the 'Human Signaling Network'.

07_Sample Results: Contains .csv sample result files for Deterministic Analysis which is performed in TISON's Networks Editor using the aforementioned parameters, fixed nodes states file and cell fate classification file.
